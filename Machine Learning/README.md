# Machine learning templates
Here I have put several machine learning models both in R and Python. 

Sometimes we don't notice that ML models use several times the same approach, that can change depending on the data that we have available and the model we want to apply.

In this section you can find the most known ML models for:
- data processing
- classification
- regression
- clustering 
- NLP
- neural network
- PCA & LDA
- Cross validations.

Each chapter is divided in two sections: one for Python and one for R. The code is always commented and you can also find some sample to test out each approach.
